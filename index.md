Flash Finder
The problem: Sometimes, UHM students who are from the mainland do not know what kind of activities they can do at UH during their free time besides studying. This is the same for locals, who get bored because they have done everything they can think of.

The solution: Flash Finder is a program where UH students and can find activities and events to do with others on the island. Students can set up notifications when a new spot or activity is posted. Students can also narrow searches down by adding tags based on their likes, where they are from on the mainland, or what high school they went to. Events and activities can also be displayed on a calendar.
