<h2 id="intro">Information</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/islandwanderer/islandwanderer">Island Wanderer</a> is the perfect website for University of Hawaii students who want to explore the islands of Hawaii with other students. Students are able to log into the website and are immediately taken to the home page, which shows postings from other students, starting with the most recent posting. Users can then filter the postings by tags - locations, dates, people, etc. Students will have the option to save posts, message the poster, or post something themselves. They can also comment on a post. Students will also have access to a personal calendar, which will hold all the events the student wants to attend. Two ways to add events to the calendar is through manually entering an event, or directly addiing an event from a post. Furthermore, students can start private messages with other students, should they have any specific questions about a post or activity. Because students don't have to "friend" other students to see their posts/directly message them, there will be the option to block certain students, should there be any issues. </p>
 
<p>The developers of this website are current University of Hawaii students who are passionate about exploring the Hawaiian Islands and love to connect with people through adventuring. If you have any comments or questions, you can contact the developers through creating an issue on the GitHub site.</p>

<h2 id="milestone1">Milestone 1</h2>

<p id="milestone1Info"><a href="https://github.com/islandwanderer/islandwanderer/projects/1">Milestone 1's</a> purpose was to improve project management by dividing the project up into multiple issues and equally distributing them amongst the group members. For the first Milestone, each group member was assigned the task of creating multiple pages necessary for the functionality of the website. Each page needed to be accessible inside the app and contain the same organization as the other pages. Furthermore, the website must have a functional landing page that contained a method of login that allowed only UH students to access to the website. The website was then deployed to <a href="https://galaxy.meteor.com/app/islandwanderer.meteorapp.com">galaxy</a>.</p>

<p id="milestone1Issues">Eight pages were initially deemed vital to the functionality of the website: Landing Page, User Home Page, Event Page, Create Event Page, Administrator Page, User Calendar, Message Page, and Edit Profile Page. Below is a description of each page as well as a picture of each page.</p>

The <a href="http://islandwanderer.meteorapp.com/">landing page</a> of the website has a small bit of information about the website and allows UH students to log in.<br>

Students are then taken to their <a href="http://islandwanderer.meteorapp.com/nmeinzen/profile">profile page</a> where they can enter their information. Students must enter their name and their email address. They can add other contact info such as facebook, slack, twitter, etc. to their account if they would like.

Students can then check their <a href="http://islandwanderer.meteorapp.com/nmeinzen/message">messages</a>, which will show all messages from groups they are apart of.
